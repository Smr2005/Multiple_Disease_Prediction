### About This System
This system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of various diseases including:

- **Diabetes**: Analyzes factors like glucose levels, BMI, and family history
- **Heart Disease**: Evaluates cardiovascular health indicators
- **Parkinson's Disease**: Examines voice and movement-related measurements
- **Lung Cancer**: Assesses respiratory symptoms and risk factors
- **Hypothyroid**: Analyzes thyroid function indicators

Each prediction model has been trained on medical datasets and provides risk assessments based on the input parameters.

    ### About Diabetes
    Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). 
    It occurs when your body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces.
    
    **Types of Diabetes:**
    - **Type 1 Diabetes**: The body doesn't produce insulin. Usually diagnosed in children and young adults.
    - **Type 2 Diabetes**: The body doesn't use insulin properly. Most common form of diabetes.
    - **Gestational Diabetes**: Develops during pregnancy in women who don't already have diabetes.
    
    **Common Symptoms:**
    - Frequent urination
    - Increased thirst and hunger
    - Unexplained weight loss
    - Fatigue
    - Blurred vision
    - Slow-healing sores
    
    **Risk Factors:**
    - Family history
    - Obesity
    - Physical inactivity
    - Age (risk increases with age)
    - High blood pressure
    - Abnormal cholesterol levels
    
    This tool uses several health metrics to assess the likelihood of diabetes based on machine learning analysis of patient data.
    
    **Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

                Diabetes is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar levels. The hormone insulin
                moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes,
                your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it makes.

                **Next Steps:**
                With a {diabetes_percentage}% risk assessment, we strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare 
                provider for proper testing and diagnosis. This prediction is not a medical diagnosis but

    ### About Heart Disease
    Heart disease refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common is coronary artery disease (CAD),
    which can lead to heart attack. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women worldwide.
    
    **Types of Heart Disease:**
    - **Coronary Artery Disease**: Narrowing or blockage of coronary arteries
    - **Heart Failure**: Heart cannot pump blood effectively
    - **Arrhythmias**: Abnormal heart rhythms
    - **Valve Disease**: Problems with heart valves
    - **Congenital Heart Defects**: Heart problems present at birth
    
    **Common Symptoms:**
    - Chest pain or discomfort (angina)
    - Shortness of breath
    - Pain or numbness in arms or shoulders
    - Fatigue
    - Irregular heartbeat
    - Dizziness or lightheadedness
    
    **Risk Factors:**
    - High blood pressure
    - High cholesterol
    - Smoking
    - Diabetes
    - Family history
    - Age (risk increases with age)
    - Physical inactivity
    - Obesity
    
    This tool uses various health metrics to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on machine learning analysis of patient data.
    
    **Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

    ### About Parkinson's Disease
    Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It develops when neurons in the brain 
    that control movement stop working properly or die, reducing the production of dopamine, a chemical that helps coordinate movement.
    
    **Key Characteristics:**
    - **Progressive**: Symptoms gradually worsen over time
    - **Neurodegenerative**: Involves the degeneration of neurons in the brain
    - **Movement Disorder**: Primarily affects motor function
    
    **Common Symptoms:**
    - Tremor (shaking) at rest
    - Bradykinesia (slowness of movement)
    - Rigidity (stiffness) in limbs
    - Postural instability (balance problems)
    - Changes in speech and voice
    - Micrographia (small, cramped handwriting)
    
    **Voice Changes in Parkinson's:**
    Voice and speech changes are common early indicators of Parkinson's disease. These include:
    - Reduced volume (hypophonia)
    - Monotone speech (lack of inflection)
    - Slurred or mumbled speech
    - Changes in voice quality (breathiness, hoarseness)
    - Abnormal speech rhythm
    
    **About This Analysis Tool:**
    This tool analyzes voice recordings to detect patterns associated with Parkinson's disease.
    The measurements below come from sustained phonations (saying 'ahhh'), where various
    properties of the voice are analyzed using acoustic parameters.
    
    **Note:** If you don't have these measurements, you can use the example values provided
    or consult with a healthcare professional for a proper assessment. This tool is for educational
    purposes only and should not replace professional medical evaluation.

        ### About Lung Cancer
        Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs and is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
        It occurs when cells in the lungs grow uncontrollably, forming tumors that interfere with lung function.
        
        **Types of Lung Cancer:**
        - **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**: Most common type (85% of cases)
          - Adenocarcinoma
          - Squamous Cell Carcinoma
          - Large Cell Carcinoma
        - **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)**: Less common but more aggressive
        
        **Common Symptoms:**
        - Persistent cough
        - Coughing up blood
        - Chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
        - Hoarseness
        - Shortness of breath
        - Wheezing
        - Unexplained weight loss
        - Fatigue
        
        **Major Risk Factors:**
        - Smoking (responsible for 80-90% of lung cancer cases)
        - Secondhand smoke exposure
        - Radon gas exposure
        - Asbestos exposure
        - Family history
        - Air pollution
        - Previous radiation therapy
        
        This tool uses various risk factors and symptoms to assess the likelihood of lung cancer based on machine learning analysis of patient data.
        
        **Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment.

                        though it can occur in non-smokers as well. It is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth
                        in tissues of the lung, which can spread to other parts of the body.

        ### About Hypothyroidism
        Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones.
        The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck that produces hormones that control 
        how your body uses energy and affects nearly every organ in your body.
        
        **Types of Hypothyroidism:**
        - **Primary Hypothyroidism**: The thyroid itself is not functioning properly
        - **Secondary Hypothyroidism**: The pituitary gland doesn't produce enough TSH to stimulate the thyroid
        - **Congenital Hypothyroidism**: Present at birth
        - **Subclinical Hypothyroidism**: Mildly elevated TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels
        
        **Common Symptoms:**
        - Fatigue and sluggishness
        - Increased sensitivity to cold
        - Constipation
        - Dry skin and hair
        - Unexplained weight gain
        - Puffy face
        - Hoarseness
        - Muscle weakness
        - Elevated cholesterol
        - Depression
        - Impaired memory
        
        **Risk Factors:**
        - Being female
        - Age over 60
        - Family history of thyroid disease
        - Autoimmune disorders (like Hashimoto's thyroiditis)
        - Previous thyroid surgery or radiation
        - Certain medications
        
        This prediction tool uses laboratory test results and patient information to assess the likelihood
        of hypothyroidism based on machine learning analysis of patient data.
        
        **Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

                        Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones.
                        Common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, and depression.
